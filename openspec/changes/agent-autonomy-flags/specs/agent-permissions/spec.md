# agent-permissions — delta spec

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Who may invoke a skill is enforced, not narrated

Where this project restricts who may invoke a vendored skill, the restriction
SHALL be carried by that skill's `disable-model-invocation` frontmatter.
`CLAUDE.md` MUST NOT be the only thing preventing an invocation, and MUST NOT
restate an instruction the skill's own `description` already carries.
A skill under `core/skills/` SHALL carry the flag only when one of its steps
is marked `(unattended: user`. The marker check SHALL fail on a skill that
carries the flag without such a step.

#### Scenario: A skill reserved for the user

- **WHEN** a skill's run merges a pull request, as `/ship`'s does, and that
  step is marked `(unattended: user`
- **THEN** `ship/SKILL.md` carries `disable-model-invocation: true`

#### Scenario: A flag with no step that stays with the user

- **WHEN** `coderabbit/SKILL.md` carries `disable-model-invocation: true` and
  none of its steps is marked `(unattended: user`
- **THEN** `bun test` fails, naming the file

#### Scenario: A skill the agent is meant to run itself

- **WHEN** a skill's `description` already says to run it proactively, as
  `/zombies` and `/warm` do
- **THEN** `CLAUDE.md` carries no "invoke it yourself" clause for it

#### Scenario: A clause that adds information

- **WHEN** this project's trigger or ordering differs from the skill's own
  description, as for `/triage`, or inverts it, as for `/ponytail-review`
- **THEN** the `CLAUDE.md` clause stays

### Requirement: The permission policy is pinned by a test

The repository's test run SHALL fail when `.claude/settings.json` stops
expressing this spec's `deny`, `ask` and hook requirements, so a later
hand-edit cannot drop the boundary silently. The check MUST read the tracked
`.claude/settings.json` and never `.claude/settings.local.json`, which is
gitignored and cannot be relied on. The requirement *Who may invoke a skill is
enforced, not narrated* is outside what this test covers: the skills sit in
`core/skills/`, their `.claude/skills/*` links are tracked, and the marker
check in `bun/autonomy.ts` reads each skill's frontmatter.

The hook is pinned on two levels: that it is registered in the settings file,
and that the script it points at behaves. Registration is a settings
assertion like the others; behaviour is asserted by running the script against
fabricated repository states, because a test that ran it against the live
repository would change its verdict with the branch.

#### Scenario: A deny entry is removed

- **WHEN** `Bash(pnpm *)` is deleted from `permissions.deny`
- **THEN** `bun test` fails

#### Scenario: A deny entry loses its word boundary

- **WHEN** a deny entry is written as `Bash(npm*)` without the space before
  the wildcard
- **THEN** `bun test` fails, because that form also blocks unrelated commands
  such as `npmlog`

#### Scenario: A deny entry uses the ignored field form

- **WHEN** a deny entry is written as `Bash(command:npm *)`
- **THEN** `bun test` fails, because Claude Code ignores that form and warns
  at startup

#### Scenario: An unreachable ask entry is reintroduced

- **WHEN** `Bash(npm install *)` is added back under `permissions.ask`
- **THEN** `bun test` fails, because deny is evaluated first and the entry can
  never be reached

#### Scenario: An ask entry is dropped

- **WHEN** `Bash(bun a *)` is deleted from `permissions.ask`
- **THEN** `bun test` fails, because an uncovered alias reaches a manifest
  write without prompting

#### Scenario: A listed form stops being a manifest write

- **WHEN** a top-level `ask` entry names a form that `bun <form> --help` no
  longer reports as one of the manifest-writing commands
- **THEN** `bun test` fails, so the list is checked against the installed
  binary in both directions rather than against a literal alone

#### Scenario: The settings file stops parsing

- **WHEN** `.claude/settings.json` contains a trailing comma
- **THEN** `bun test` fails rather than passing on an unread file

#### Scenario: A skill's frontmatter changes

- **WHEN** `disable-model-invocation: true` is added to a skill under
  `core/skills/` that marks no step `(unattended: user`
- **THEN** the settings test still passes, and `bun test` fails on the marker
  check, naming the file

#### Scenario: A GitHub write entry is dropped

- **WHEN** `Bash(gh pr comment *)` is deleted from `permissions.deny`
- **THEN** `bun test` fails

#### Scenario: The hook loses its registration

- **WHEN** the `PreToolUse` entry is removed from `.claude/settings.json`, or
  its command no longer runs the tracked script, or it loses its `|| exit 2`
  fallback
- **THEN** `bun test` fails

#### Scenario: The hook stops blocking

- **WHEN** the script is run against a fabricated repository whose `HEAD` is
  on `main`, with a commit command on stdin
- **THEN** it exits `2`, and `bun test` fails on any other code

#### Scenario: An event the hook cannot read

- **WHEN** the script is given a payload with no `tool_input.command`
- **THEN** it exits `2` — a non-blocking code here would let an unread git
  command run, which is the case the hook is for

#### Scenario: The hook stops catching a force-push

- **WHEN** the script is run on a feature branch with `git push origin feat/x
  --force` on stdin
- **THEN** it exits `2`, and `bun test` fails if it does not — the flag scan is
  a separate path from the branch check and the reordered flag is the form no
  permission entry could have caught
